            <p>
                This stacked area chart shows how total boardings are distributed across MBTA stations, broken down by subway line and time of day. Each section of color represents a different transit line—Red, Orange, Green, or Blue—making it easy to see how different routes contribute to overall ridership. Taller stacks indicate higher boardings at particular stations, helping to spotlight the busiest stops in the system. By adjusting the filters, users can explore trends for specific lines and time periods to better understand where and when ridership peaks. This visualization offers valuable insight for transit planners and riders alike, supporting decisions about service planning and travel timing.

                        <h4>Peak Ridership Trends</h4>
                        <p>
                            Across all routes, peak ridership consistently occurs during the traditional weekday rush hours, especially in the morning and late afternoon. This pattern reflects the MBTA’s role in supporting commuter traffic to and from major employment centers in Boston. Stations located near business districts or large transfer points — like Downtown Crossing, Park Street, and South Station — experience the highest concentration of boardings during these peak periods. The bump chart visualization highlights how certain stations sharply climb in rank during these times, indicating their pivotal role in the network during high-demand hours.

Interestingly, weekend ridership trends show a flatter distribution, with fewer extreme peaks. While the same major stations remain busy, their dominance is less pronounced outside of the typical workweek. Tourist-friendly stops and stations near shopping or event venues, like Government Center and Prudential, maintain steady rankings. This shift suggests that while weekday travel is driven by work-related needs, weekend boardings are more evenly spread across leisure and entertainment destinations, reflecting different rider priorities.

                        <h4>Route Comparisons</h4>
                        <p>
                            When comparing routes, the Red and Orange Lines consistently dominate in terms of total boardings per station. The Red Line, serving dense residential neighborhoods and major institutions like Harvard and MIT, shows a particularly strong presence across multiple stops. The bump chart clearly demonstrates how Red Line stations frequently cluster toward the bottom ranks (indicating higher boarding numbers) during peak periods. In contrast, the Green Line, with its multiple branches and more fragmented service patterns, exhibits greater variation — some branches maintain strong boardings, while others trail behind.

The Blue Line stands out for its narrower range of consistently busy stops. Its limited coverage area compared to the other lines likely contributes to fewer high-ranking stations overall. However, key Blue Line stations still show distinct jumps during peak commuter times, especially those connecting to the downtown core. Overall, the bump chart reveals how the structural differences between lines — whether in terms of route length, connectivity, or service frequency — shape the boarding patterns and relative importance of their major stops.

            <h3><i class="fas fa-bullseye"></i> Implications</h3>
            <p>
                These insights can inform transit planning and policy decisions, such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Adjusting train frequencies with greater precision to match demand surges during peak commuting hours, minimizing delays and overcrowding.

</li>
                <li>Enhancing infrastructure at high-traffic stations, including wider platforms, improved signage, and better crowd flow design to support consistent rider volume.</li>
                <li>Refining service schedules and stop patterns using station-specific ridership trends, allowing for more data-driven deployment of resources and improved passenger experience across different times and routes.

</li>
            </ul>
