                        <h4> Central Boston Transfer Stations</h4>
                        <p>
                            The stations with the highest average daily flow—Park Street, Downtown Crossing, South Station, and 
                            North Station—are all located within the "Central Boston" area. This concentration of high-traffic stations 
                            suggests that Central Boston serves as a major hub for both employment and tourism. Notably, three of the 
                            four busiest stations are marked in black, indicating they are transfer points between multiple subway 
                            lines, which naturally drives higher foot traffic. While South Station is not shown as a transfer station in 
                            this visualization—since it only services the MBTA Red Line—it’s important to recognize its broader role as 
                            a key intermodal hub. South Station connects the Red Line with the MBTA Commuter Rail system, which falls 
                            outside the scope of the subway dataset used, but likely contributes significantly to its high flow.
                            This visualization highlights how transportation infrastructure and urban geography intersect in Central Boston. 
                            Its dominance in station traffic underscores the area's economic and cultural significance. The prominence of 
                            transfer stations among the busiest stops suggests that network connectivity is a key driver of ridership. 
                            Additionally, the exclusion of intermodal transit connections, like those at South Station, may lead to 
                            underestimating the true volume and importance of certain locations. Future analyses that integrate commuter 
                            rail and bus networks could provide a more complete picture of transit flow across the city.

                        <h4> Transfer Stations</h4>
                        <p>
                           Outside of Central Boston, stations with moderate to high flow are primarily located in wards like
                            Fenway/Kenmore, Back Bay, East Boston, Charlestown, Jamaica Plain/Mission Hill, South End, and Dorchester. 
                            These neighborhoods, while not the commercial core, still host a mix of residential density, educational 
                            institutions, and local economic activity, supporting regular ridership. Surrounding towns such as Brookline, 
                            Newton, Cambridge, and Malden also demonstrate notable transit usage, reflecting their integration into the 
                            greater Boston commuting network.
                            However, a clear disparity in MBTA subway accessibility emerges across several Boston wards. Areas like 
                            Roxbury, Hyde Park, Roslindale/Moss Hill/West Roxbury, Seaport, Mattapan, North Dorchester, and 
                            Allston/Brighton show sparse or no subway service. This uneven distribution points to broader geographical, 
                            economic, and social inequities. For example, the Seaport District—despite its rapid development into a business
                            and residential hub—lacks direct subway access due to its location on reclaimed land and the prohibitive cost 
                            of extending existing lines. As a result, it relies on the Silver Line, a bus rapid transit service that offers
                            limited capacity and convenience compared to subway infrastructure.
                            Similarly, Mattapan is served by the Mattapan Trolley, a light rail line rather than a full subway 
                            connection. Historical decisions around infrastructure costs and priorities have contributed to limited 
                            service in this area. These examples highlight how infrastructural investment—or the lack thereof—can shape
                            mobility, economic opportunity, and urban growth in different neighborhoods. A more equitable transit future 
                            would require deliberate planning and investment to better connect historically underserved communities to the
                            city’s core.
