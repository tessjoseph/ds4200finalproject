        <h2>Key Takeaways from MBTA Ridership Analysis</h2>

        <div class="takeaway">
            <h3>1. MBTA Ridership is Highly Dependent on Work and School Commutes</h3>
            <p>
                The **line plot** and **heatmap** both reveal that **ridership is concentrated around morning (AM_PEAK) and evening (PM_PEAK) hours**.  
                This pattern strongly suggests that the MBTA primarily serves **commuters traveling to work and school**, with significantly **lower ridership on weekends**.  
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Recommendation:</strong>  
                To improve service, MBTA could explore **reallocating resources** by increasing train frequency during peak hours and reducing underused services during midday and weekends.  
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="takeaway">
            <h3>2. Major Transfer Stations Experience Consistently High Traffic</h3>
            <p>
                The **interactive heatmap** shows that stations like **Downtown Crossing, Park Street, and North Station** have **continuously high passenger flow** across all time periods.  
                These stations act as crucial **transfer points**, meaning that congestion at these locations could impact the overall efficiency of the transit system.  
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Recommendation:</strong>  
                To reduce congestion, MBTA could consider **infrastructure improvements** such as expanded platforms, better crowd flow management, or express trains that bypass high-traffic areas.  
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="takeaway">
            <h3>3. The Green Line Operates Differently from Other Subway Lines</h3>
            <p>
                Unlike other MBTA subway lines, the **Green Line branches** have **more evenly distributed ridership** outside the downtown core.  
                This pattern suggests that the Green Line **primarily serves residential and suburban areas**, rather than high-density business districts.  
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Recommendation:</strong>  
                MBTA planners could explore **increasing service frequency on Green Line branches** during non-peak hours to support more flexible commuting and local travel.  
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="takeaway">
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                The findings from this project highlight **critical ridership trends** that can inform **service optimizations**.  
                By focusing on **peak-hour efficiency, infrastructure improvements, and Green Line accessibility**, MBTA can enhance overall **commuter experience and system efficiency**.
