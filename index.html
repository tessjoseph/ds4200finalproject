        <p>Our project examines how ridership on Boston’s MBTA “T” system is shaped by spatial, temporal, and socioeconomic factors. We’re particularly interested in patterns of station use such as which stops are busiest, when peak travel occurs, and how income levels correlate with transit dependency. This analysis allows us to evaluate the effectiveness and reach of the city’s public transit network. By doing so, we aim to contribute to broader discussions around equity in urban infrastructure and accessibility in public transportation.
