            <h2>About the Project</h2>
            <p>
                For our project, we looked at the MBTA - or Massachusetts bay transportation authority’s dataset for Rail or “T” Ridership by Time Period, 
                Line, and Station. As boston-based students who frequently use the “T”, we really wanted to gain a better understanding of the T’s traffic
                patterns.

                We aim to uncover trends in station usage and identify possible mismatches between transit demand and service availability. 
                And by doing so, we hope to highlight where improvements could be made to better serve the diverse communities that rely on public
                transit in the city.
            </p>
            <p>
                To support this analysis, we’re working with MBTA rail ridership data from MassDOT’s public portal. The dataset covers three seasonal snapshots 
                (2017, 2018, and 2019) and includes information such as station names, boarding and alighting counts, service days, and routes. 
                In total, it contains over 7,900 entries across 17 attributes. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Our core research question asks: how do geographic and temporal factors shape ridership patterns on the MBTA? 
                More specifically, are some stations overburdened while others are underutilized? 
                And do current service levels meet the actual needs of the communities they’re intended to serve? How can we make the "T" more efficient
                for its users?
            </p>

            <p>
                The potential impact of our work extends to planners, policymakers, and even community members. By making ridership patterns more visible,
                this project can help identify gaps in service and suggest where resources might be more effectively allocated. 
            </p>
            <p>
                For this project, we’ve chosen to focus on MBTA heavy and light rail lines, leaving out commuter rail and bus networks to keep the scope manageable and the analysis consistent. 
                By zeroing in on three years of subway data, we can capture  and year-to-year changes while maintaining clarity in our results. 
                The final product will include a mix of static charts and interactive maps, allowing users to explore the data from both broad and detailed perspectives.
