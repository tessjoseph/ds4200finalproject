            <h2>About the Project</h2>
            <p>
                Our project explores how ridership on Boston’s MBTA “T” system varies across different neighborhoods, times of day, and income levels. 
                We aim to uncover trends in station usage and identify possible mismatches between transit demand and service availability. 
                By doing so, we hope to highlight where improvements could be made to better serve the diverse communities that rely on public transit in the city.
            </p>
            <p>
                To support this analysis, we’re working with MBTA rail ridership data from MassDOT’s public portal. The dataset covers three seasonal snapshots 
                (Fall 2017, Fall 2018, and Fall 2019) and includes information such as station names, boarding and alighting counts, service days, and routes. 
                In total, it contains over 7,900 entries across 17 attributes. To add depth to our findings, we are combining this with demographic data 
                like population density and median income at the neighborhood level.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our core research question asks: how do socioeconomic, geographic, and temporal factors shape ridership patterns on the MBTA? 
                More specifically, are lower-income areas more dependent on public transit? Are some stations overburdened while others are underutilized? 
                And do current service levels meet the actual needs of the communities they’re intended to serve?
            </p>
            <p>
                We were motivated by the idea that transportation is not just about mobility—it’s about equity. Public transit is a lifeline for many residents, 
                connecting people to jobs, healthcare, and education. However, not all communities experience the same level of access or service quality. 
                By investigating these patterns, we hope to provide insights that help inform more inclusive and effective transit planning.
            </p>
            <p>
                The potential impact of our work extends to planners, policymakers, and even community members. By making ridership patterns more visible, 
                especially in relation to neighborhood income levels, this project can help identify gaps in service and suggest where resources might be 
                more effectively allocated. Our findings also feed into the broader conversation around urban equity and the role of data in shaping public infrastructure.
            </p>
            <p>
                For this project, we’ve chosen to focus on MBTA heavy and light rail lines, leaving out commuter rail and bus networks to keep the scope manageable and the analysis consistent. 
                By zeroing in on three years of subway data, we can capture seasonal shifts and year-to-year changes while maintaining clarity in our results. 
                The final product will include a mix of static charts and interactive maps, allowing users to explore the data from both broad and detailed perspectives.
